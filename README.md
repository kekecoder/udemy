# Hello World

This repo is all about udemy course, Fullstack Web Developer using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, As i made progress, this document will be updated.

## My Progress First Project - Image Gallery

I learnt about CSS after completing the html section of the program, i created an image gallery demo site with the use of CSS3 flexbox, and added some little CSS3 animation property to make it look sleeks and beautiful. First project completed.
There was also a robot task given, it has been completed, unto the one.

## Second Project - Landing Page

I learnt about Bootstrap, use it to create my secong project which is a landing page, the experience was amazing, it taught me on how to make use of others people work, modify it and create something better with it instead of writing everything from the ground up, it's been super fun so far.

## Learn About CSS GRID

So i learn how to use both CSS GRID and FLEXBOX to create a beautiful layout for my web project, created a project with it also, looking nice and crisp, now to the next one which is Javascript.

## JavaScript Journey Has Begun

The introduction to JavaScript was fun, learn the basic of variable, performing basic mathematics calculation with JavaScript was fun, was abl to code a little basic calculator following the exercises and using my browser Developer Console to create it, also learnt about the differences between var, let and constant keyword.
Learned about how to create and store variables with `var`, `let` and `const` keyword, learned about functions, calling functions. Update my basic calculator with functions by adjusting it to make it look better.
Learning about array, storing an item in an array, how to access multi dimensional array, it has been fun so far, am happy to learn more.
With the new knowledge i learnt, i was able to create a mini project where users will be able to login, just like facebook kind of thing, the take away from the project is that, i learn more about using loops, array and functions in javascript.
Learn about Javascript DOM whereby i was about to manipulate the Elements, change backgound, update it etc. The DOM opened my eyes to many use cases whereby i can modify what has been done with both HTML and CSS. I also created a little **TODO LIST** app with my new found techniques :smile::satisfied:
